                <h2>Design &amp; Creativity</h2>
                <p>In this course we explored various techniques that can help during the creative process of thinking up of new ideas. Such ideas included brainstorming techniques. During the class we divided the creative process in three parts: The diverging par, converging part and iterating. During the diverging phase one thinks of as many ideas as possible without any contraints. The converging phase focusses on trying to filter out the best ideas from all of the ideas of the diverging phase. Iterating is less of a phase, but more of a process one should constantly do during their creative process to keep checking if they are still designing for what they set out to design.</p>

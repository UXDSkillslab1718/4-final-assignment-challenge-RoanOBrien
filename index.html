                <h2 class="titleBackground">Hobbies</h2>

                <h3>Volleyball / Beachvolleyball</h3>
                <p>I play volleyball in a team three times a week. I also train another team of beginning ladies in volleyball.</p>

                <h3>Reading and watching movies</h3>
                <p>I love to read and watch a lot of movies in my spare time. In regards to genres I mainly prefer fantasy, thrillers and British comedies.</p>

                <h3>Architecture</h3>
                <p>Although I dropped out of the bachelor of Architecture at the TU Delft, I am still very much interested in architecture. I just prefer to be active with it as a hobby in stead of a full study/job.</p>

                <h3>Playing nerdy board games with friends</h3>
                <p>I also love playing nerdy games with some of my friends from my volleyball club. Games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons. When we play these kind of games we will just chill at someone's house and play the game all evening long. </p>
